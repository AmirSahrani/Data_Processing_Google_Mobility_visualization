# Data_Processing_Google_Mobility_visualization
Hello,
This is my final project for data processing, it is an interactive map containing mobility data from 2020-2020.
In order to run all the code in the workbook you need a large csv file which I cannot supply via github, 
you can however download all the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bigquery/covid19-google-mobility, 
and run the csv merger on those files. Finally you can run the actual dash app without downloading such large files, 
you only need the assests folder, the parquet file and app.py
